Hi, I am Satya Prakash Dwivedi, a passionate self taught front-end web developer and a student who likes to contribute in society by educating school students. 
My passion for software lies with dreaming ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open source contributor, who likes to grow and give back to community and network with people.
I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

Languages = java, c++, python, HTML, CSS, JS, Golang.

Ask me about anything, I am happy to help.
